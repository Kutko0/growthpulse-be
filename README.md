# The GrowthPulse application
## Development notes
To run the application, use the standard dotnet run command.  
Example: From the git repository root, run the following:  
`dotnet run GrowthPulse/Api/Program.cs`

That will build and launch the application. You can access the Swagger API definition at the URL  
`https://localhost:7235/swagger/index.html`
