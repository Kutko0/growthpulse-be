# The GrowthPulse application
## Development notes

Install dotnet CLI for Linux here:
[MSC Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual)

To run the application, use the standard dotnet run command.  
Example: From the git repository root, run the following:  
`dotnet run GrowthPulse/Api/Program.cs`

That will build and launch the application. You can access the Swagger API definition at the URL
